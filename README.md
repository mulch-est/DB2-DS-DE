# de blob 2 (DS) Dialogue Editor
A dialogue editor for de blob 2 (DS)

### To Use
[Get RubyInstaller](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/), and run it to install Ruby. After installing Ruby you can open the .rb file with the Ruby interpreter (or start the command prompt with Ruby, navigate to the DB2-DS-DE-master folder, and execute
`ruby editor.rb`).
The version should not matter too much, but **Ruby+Devkit 2.6.5-1 (x64)** was used during testing.
